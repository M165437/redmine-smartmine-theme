Smartmine - a Redmine theme
===========================

Smartmine is a Redmine theme customized for smartphones. The purpose of this theme was to get a fairly good look on the iPhone including running it from the home screen (webapp-ish). It's not yet completed and I'm not planing on finishing it with any rush. Contribute if you like!

It has been tested with [Redmine](http://redmine.org) 1.2.0


Instructions
------------

1. Copy the smartmine folder into `/public/themes`
2. Move all files beginning with "apple-touch-icon" into `/public`
3. Activate the theme in Redmine (Administration > Settings > Display > Theme)


Known issues
------------

I haven't touched every module so some of them are running too wide.
